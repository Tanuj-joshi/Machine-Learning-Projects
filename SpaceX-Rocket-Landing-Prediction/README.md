# SpaceX Rocket Landing Prediction


![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/lab_v2/images/landing_1.gif)



In this Project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

The project is divided into multiple tasks which are performed in individual jupyter notebook file: 

1) Data Collection using SpaceX api
2) Data Collection using webscraping
3) Data Wrangling - determining training labels
4) Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
5) Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
6) Interactive Visual Analytics using Folium
7) Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

Goal is to predict if the first stage will land using Machine Learning.
