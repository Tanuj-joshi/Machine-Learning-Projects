# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several machine learning, data-science projects. Each project is organized into its own folder. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Project List

### 1. House-Price-Predictor
A Flask-based House price predictor application that predict price of a house based on Location, Number of bathrooms, Number of BHks and Area(sqft). Uses popular machine learning library scikit-learn and regression models.

### 2. Movie-Recommender-System
A Streamlit-based movie recommender system that suggests movies and displays their posters using similarity scores and The Movie Database API. Uses scikit-learn functions and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

### 3. Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
An object detection project that uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade algorithm to detect Faces and Eyes on humans in images and videos, detect Pedestrians and Cars on Videos, detect Car's Plate on Images.

### 4. Turbofan-Predictive-Maintenance
A predictive maintenance project that predicts the remaining useful life of turbofan engines based on sensor data. Uses scikit-learn, multivariate time-series analysis, classification model and feature engineering.
